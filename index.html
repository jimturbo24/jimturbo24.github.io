            <p class="text-justify">I am a biochemist beginning a new career as a
              Software Developer. I come from a background in higher education and
               biomedical research that have served me well for the past several
               years. As a biochemist I had the opportunity to use and develop some
               of the most innovative and cutting-edge techniques known to biomedical
               science. I loved encountering difficult biological or biophysical
               problems that at times seem too intimidating to solve, and the thrill
               of chipping away at the problem until the solution had been found. I
               also enjoyed working with a team of very smart people that were committed
               to finding the answers to those tough problems along with me. As an educator
               I was able to break hard concepts down into small pieces in order that
               someone new to the subject could easily understand. I had fun in the
               classroom and I think (I hope) most of my students did too.
             </p>
             <p>
               I have chosen to pursue a career in software development because I
               know that developers experience many of the same situations that I have
               experienced as an educator and a researcher. Instead of solving problems
               that involve DNA and proteins, they solve problems that involve CSS and
               databases. I am confident that I will be able to use my past career
               experiences to add value to development teams in the future. If you are
               in need of a junior developer with mature problem solving and excellent
               communication skills (not to mention newly aquired python skills), please
               feel free to contact me via the links above.

              Mom's Best Friend</a> is an application help parents keep track of
              their infants non-vital information (How much milk did they drink?
              , what was in their diaper?, when did they go to sleep?....).
              Other apps only allow one user to log in and edit an infants record.
              This app allows multiple users to log in and edit the same infants
               records. This is extremely useful for parents who have others
               helping to care for their children (e.g. nanny or grandparents).
